# LLM Comparisons

> Can't rely solely on OpenAI and Azure for WiseGuyAI.com. Need to compare the other LLMs based on price, performance, and quality.

## LLMs

1. OpenAI
2. Cohere
3. A121
4. Huggingface Hub
5. Azure OpenAI
6. Manifest
7. Goose Al
8. Cerebrium
9. Petals
10. Forefront AI
11. PromptLayer OpenAI
12. Anthropic
13. Self-Hosted Models (via Runhouse)

## Idk

All LLMs will need to be tested to with the same prompt to see how they compare. We need to keep track of the duration of each request. We also need to try each request at least 3 times to be sure that it gets it correct. 

We can figure out the prices before we even run most of these models. 

Gonna use langchain to hopefully make this a little bit easier.

Need to sign up for all these services -_-

Will track the progress of each by hand in this document + notebooks whenever possible. Honestly maybe this should be a notebook just keep better track.
